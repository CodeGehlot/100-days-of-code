# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 6, 2021 

**Today's Progress**:

**Day 1 - What I have learned today**
Learned about printing, how to solve errors (Google)
Using backslash - (\n) to use the next line inside the print statement.
Input function - needs to have in variable so that the value can be stored inside the variable.
Thonny - A software that will explain step by step, line by line of the code for a detailed explanation.
Basic Data Types - String, Integer, Float, Boolean
Subscript - Pulling out a particular element from a string. “Hello”[0]
Type check - type() it will show type of data

*PEMDAS priority* - 
- Parentheses ()
- Exponents **
- Multiplication *
- Division /
- Addition +
- Subtraction -

Round function - round(45.56, 2) or Format function "{:.2f}".format(int)
- f-String - print(f”Hello {variable}”)
- Avoid float - Using // gets the whole number

### Day 2: September 7, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: 

*Comparision operators:*
- Greater than >
- Less than <
- Greater than equal to >=
- Less than equal to <=
- Not equal to !=
- Equal to ==

#Modulo operator %
- Gives the remainder
- If 4/x2 is = 2 which gives no remainder than it is even number.
- if 4/3 is = 3 x 1 + 1 which gives 1 as a remainder than it is odd number.

#Multiple if statements
- Nested if statement (Like an inception)

*Solving if else questions is easier when we prepare a flow chart. Create either on paper first or at draw.io website.*

#Logical Operators -
- AND, OR and NOT

**Thoughts**: Initially the project questions were difficult but after examining it again and again and later taking a break for a while and then coming up with step by step procedure, did the solution came correctly and code executed smoothly. Really when you get stuck, all you need it just take a break and come back later and you will have step by step solution on your own.

### Day 3: September 8th, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Random Module and Python Lists
- random.int and many more can be found from AskPython document.
- List can have append, replace etc
- nested list: list inside list

Had fun doing few projects mixing with random module, lists, conditional operators and if-elif-else statement combinations.

**Thoughts**: Still needs to polish random module, other than that had fun creating Rock, paper, scissor game.

### Day 4: September 9th, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 
- For Loop
- range 
- random.choice, random.shuffle

First two questions were easy to solve using all the previous lessons and for the last part of question 
I was not able to come to terms so I looked into the solution and then it did make sense

**Thoughts**: Will still come back to it and work on it again and try to make sense

### Day 5: September 10th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 
- Functions.
- Code Blocks
- While Loops
