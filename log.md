# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 6, 2021 

**Today's Progress**:

**Day 1 - What I have learned today**
Learned about printing, how to solve errors (Google)
Using backslash - (\n) to use the next line inside the print statement.
Input function - needs to have in variable so that the value can be stored inside the variable.
Thonny - A software that will explain step by step, line by line of the code for a detailed explanation.
Basic Data Types - String, Integer, Float, Boolean
Subscript - Pulling out a particular element from a string. “Hello”[0]
Type check - type() it will show type of data

*PEMDAS priority* - 
Parentheses ()
Exponents **
Multiplication *
Division /
Addition +
Subtraction -

Round function - round(45.56, 2) or Format function "{:.2f}".format(int)
f-String - print(f”Hello {variable}”)
Avoid float - Using // gets the whole number

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
